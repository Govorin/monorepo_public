# Frontend Developer Monorepo by Govorin Victor

Hello, fellow developers! My name is Govorin Victor and this is my public monorepo for all things frontend development. I am primarily an Angular developer, but I am also currently exploring Vue and React.

This repo is built using the Nx monorepo management tool, which allows for efficient development and sharing of code across multiple projects.

Within this repo, you will find several projects and libraries that I hope will be useful to you in your own work.
